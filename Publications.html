                <p class=abstract>In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, interethnic tension between whites and Roma is long-standing, with racially-motivated crimes and anti-Roma demonstrations occasionally making international news. In Slovakia, where the Roma population is even more impoverished and relations are just as tense, group-level interethnic conflict (as measured by the frequency of anti-Roma demonstrations) does not occur as often as in the Czech Republic. Integrated church organizations in Slovakia (nearly absent amongst mostly atheist Czechs), provides opportunities for associational interethnic contact, known to contain conflict. In this paper, however, I find that the mediating and brokering functions performed by Slovak church organizations and church representatives integrate these organizations to varying extents, but perceived threat to majority group position limits their ability to transform the unequal majority/Roma relationship. With evidence from semi-structured interviews conducted from June 2014-June 2015, I find two mechanisms by which integrated Slovak church organizations carefully manage the symbolic threat to white superiority, and hence contain potential conflict: (1) they focus on the physical needs and spiritual development of their clients rather than on advocating for their equal rights as citizens, and (2) they structure and/or limit interethnic contact in ways that require the least accommodation on the part of the white majority population. Findings have implications for all multi-ethnic societies interested in maintaining interethnic peace. </p>
