Professional Website for S Tomczuk

Currently stored at: https://xtuo.github.io/stomczuk/.

This submission is the index/homepage of a website that I plan to build out for my friend, Sara Tomczuk, who will be getting her PhD from the UW Sociology department this summer.  I plan to continue working on the site after this class has ended by building out pages that describe her research, teaching, bio, and CV. I used the Bootstrap CSS framework to assist in building the Navbar.
